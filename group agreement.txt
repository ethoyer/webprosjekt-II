One meeting a week should contain some planning(probably Friday).

Rules:
Don’t be late.
	If you will be late or cannot attend a meeting let us know asap.
Ask for help when necessary – don’t struggle on a question alone.
Be open about your own personal schedule/availability.
Participate in planning and decision making.
If a member does not succeed in delivering what was assigned to them in time (unless problems happened and they informed the group) they have one week to do so. If after one week they still haven't done so it will be noted and after 3 times Carlos will be contacted.
